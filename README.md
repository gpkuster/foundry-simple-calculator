# 📘 Calculator Smart Contract

This is a simple educational project where I created a basic **Calculator smart contract** using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

It supports four basic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and includes unit tests.

## 📚 About the Project

This is the **first smart contract project** I wrote using Foundry.  
The goal was to learn how to:

- Write and structure a smart contract
- Use events and access control
- Write tests with Foundry's `forge-std` framework

I kept the code and test cases simple so it's easier to read and understand.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- ✅ Emits events for each operation
- ✅ Only admin can change the result manually
- ✅ Division by zero protection
- ✅ Full test suite using Foundry

## 🧪 Run the tests

Make sure you have [Foundry installed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Then, clone the repo and run:

```
forge test -vv
```
